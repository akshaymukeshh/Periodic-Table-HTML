        <h1>React</h1> <hr>
        <h2>Create User interfaces
            Using Components.
        </h2>
        <p style = "color: black; background-color: aqua;">
            React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.<br>
            Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video.<br>
            Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p style = "color: black; background-color: aqua;">
            Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions,<br>
            but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, <br>
            in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.<br>
        </p> <hr>
        <h2>
            React components receive data and return what should appear on the screen. 
            You can pass them new data in response to an interaction, like when the user types into an input. 
            React will then update the screen to match the new data.
        </h2><br>
        <h2>Add React to Your Page</h2>
        <p>
            You don’t have to build your whole page in React. <br>
            Add React to your existing HTML page, and render interactive React components anywhere on it.
        </p><br>
        <h1>Start a New React Project</h1>
        <h3>If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React,<br> 
            we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community.</h3>
        <h2>You can use React without a framework, however we’ve found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common problems such as code-splitting, <br>
            routing, data fetching, and generating HTML. These problems are common to all UI libraries, not just React.</h2>
        <p style = "font-size: 20px;">
            By starting with a framework, you can get started with React quickly, <br>
            and avoid essentially building your own framework later.
